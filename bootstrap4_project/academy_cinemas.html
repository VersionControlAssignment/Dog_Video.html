<h3>Sean Gunn On Kraglin's Transformation In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</h3>
<p>Sean Gunn, aka Kraglin, joins us at the red carpet premiere of Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 to chat about being directed by brother James Gunn, and Kraglin's transition from Ravager to full-fledged Guardian.</p>
<p>In Marvel Studios "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3" our beloved band of misfits are looking a bit different these days. Peter Quill, still reeling from the loss of Gamora, must rally his team around him to defend the universe along with protecting one of their own. A mission that, if not completed successfully, could quite possibly lead to the end of the Guardians as we know them.</p>
<p>CAST-Chris Pratt, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Sean Gunn, Will Poulter, Maria Bakalova and Chukwudi Iwuji</p>
