<h2><blockquote> Tag</h2>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockquote_element">
<p>The blockquote element is used to indicate the quotation of a large section of text from another source.
Using the default HTML styling of most web browsers,
it will indent the right and left margins both on the display and in printed form,
but this may be overridden by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
The non-semantic use of the blockquote element purely to indent text has been deprecated by the W3C
(World Wide Web Consortium) since HTML 4.[2] The preferred approach is the use of CSS.</p>
